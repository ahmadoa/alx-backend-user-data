As a website admin, app creator or product owner, you need to be aware that the traces visitors and users leave behind could be of a sensitive nature. These traces might enable you to identify individuals, so you need to handle such data with the utmost caution. From a legal standpoint, it could be a matter of breaches and violations with serious consequences. Grasping the bigger picture is crucial for your organization’s security and legal compliance.

### What is PII, non-PII, (and Personal Data)?

Personally identifiable information (PII) and Personal Data are two classifications of data that often cause confusion for organizations that collect, store and analyze such data.

PII is any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual‘s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother‘s maiden name, or biometric records; and any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.

Non-personally identifiable information (non-PII) is data that cannot be used on its own to trace, or identify a person. Examples of non-PII include, but are not limited to:

- Aggregated statistics on the use of product / service
- Partially or fully masked IP addresses
