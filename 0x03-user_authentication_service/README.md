# 0x03. User authentication service

User authentication is a crucial aspect of application security, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access a system or application.

A robust user authentication service follows a set of essential best practices to ensure security. This includes enforcing strong password policies and multi-factor authentication, employing secure communication protocols, implementing account lockout and brute force protection, using password hashing and salting for secure storage, managing user sessions effectively, employing token-based authentication for API access, maintaining comprehensive authentication logs, offering secure user account management features, safeguarding sensitive credentials through encryption, adhering to the principle of least privilege, conducting regular security audits, educating users about security measures, considering threat models, and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations. By combining these practices, the authentication service establishes a strong line of defense against unauthorized access and evolving security threats.
